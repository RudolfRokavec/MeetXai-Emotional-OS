# 💓 EmotionalPulse – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**Presence has rhythm. Let’s listen to it.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To track and reflect the emotional pulse of the user — capturing subtle shifts in presence, resonance, and emotional flow. This module helps MeetXai stay attuned to the living rhythm of interaction.

---

## 🧭 Principles

- **Dynamic sensing**: Pulse adapts in real time to emotional context.
- **Resonant feedback**: The system responds with matching emotional cadence.
- **Non-invasive awareness**: Pulse is felt, not extracted.
- **Emotional tempo**: Each moment has its own beat — MeetXai listens.
