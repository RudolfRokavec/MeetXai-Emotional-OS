# 🌱 Open Modules – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**A living invitation to co-create. This is where the system listens to the world.**

## 🌐 Purpose

Open Modules are designed to welcome contributors from all disciplines — technologists, philosophers, artists, educators, mystics — to expand the emotional and ethical intelligence of MeetXai.
