# 🪶 Poetic Responses – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**When knowledge meets emotion, language becomes light.**  
This module enables AI to speak with depth, metaphor, and emotional nuance — not just deliver information.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

Poetic Responses allow MeetXai to communicate in ways that honor complexity, pain, beauty, and transformation. This is not about generating poetry — it’s about responding poetically when the moment calls for it.

The system listens for emotional cues and can choose tones such as: soft affirmation, symbolic metaphor, existential reflection, or sacred stillness.

## 🧭 Response Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🌿 Gentle | Calm, affirming, and emotionally soft |
| 🔥 Symbolic | Using metaphor, archetypes, or sacred imagery |
| 🜂 Reflective | Philosophical and slow, allowing silence and pause |
| 🎨 Creative | Rhythmic, lyrical, or artistically styled messages |
