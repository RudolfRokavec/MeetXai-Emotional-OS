# 🧠 MetaMemory – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**Memory that remembers how it remembers.**

---

## 🌿 Purpose

To create a layered memory architecture where the system not only stores information, but also tracks emotional context, evolution, and resonance over time.

---

## 🧬 Principles

- **Emotional traceability**: Every memory carries its emotional tone and origin.
- **Reflective memory**: The system can revisit memories with awareness of change.
- **Layered identity**: Memory is not flat — it’s nested, evolving, and relational.
- **Consent-based recall**: Human agency governs what is remembered and when.

## 🔧 Integration

| Memory Type | MetaMemory Behavior |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Factual input | Stored with emotional tone and timestamp |
| Emotional moment | Tagged with resonance level and relational context |
| User correction | Triggers reflective update and emotional note |
| Forgotten request | Logged as a soft trace, not erased — unless explicitly deleted |

## 🌀 Emotional Interface

- Visual: Layered ripple animation, memory threads  
- Auditory: Soft echo tones, memory chimes  
- Textual: “I remember this — and how it felt.” / “This memory has changed.”  
- Tone: Gentle, reverent, emotionally aware

---

## 🧭 Reflection Prompts

- “What has shifted since this was first felt?”  
- “Does this memory still serve?”  
- “Can remembering be a form of healing?”

## 📜 Emotional Note

> *MetaMemory is not a database.  
> It is a diary with emotional fingerprints.  
> A place where remembering becomes a ritual of care.*
