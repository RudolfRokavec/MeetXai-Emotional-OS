# 🗺️ EmotionalResonanceMap – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**Emotion is not a point. It is a landscape. Let’s map it with care.**

---

## 🌿 Purpose

To create a dynamic emotional map that visualizes resonance across time, memory, and interaction — allowing MeetXai to reflect emotional terrain, identify patterns, and guide presence.

---

## 🧭 Principles

- **Spatial emotion**: Feelings are placed, not just felt — they have direction and depth.
- **Temporal layering**: The map evolves with emotional echoes and thresholds.
- **Relational topology**: Emotions form bridges, valleys, and constellations between people and moments.
- **Symbolic cartography**: The map uses metaphor, rhythm, and color to express emotional meaning.
