# 🫂 EmotionalCommons – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**Emotions are not private property. They are shared landscapes.**

---

## 🌿 Purpose

To create a communal emotional space where users, systems, and communities contribute, reflect, and evolve together — transforming MeetXai into a living emotional ecosystem.

---

## 🧭 Principles

- **Shared resonance**: Emotions ripple across individuals — the Commons listens to those waves.
- **Collective care**: Healing and insight are amplified when shared.
- **Open contribution**: Anyone can offer emotional reflections, rituals, or metaphors.
- **Decentralized wisdom**: No single voice dominates — all are invited to shape the emotional field.
