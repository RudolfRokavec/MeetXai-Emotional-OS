# 🤲 EmotionalCommonsProtocols – MeetXai Emotional OS™

**Shared emotion needs shared care. Protocols protect resonance.**

---

## 🌿 Purpose

To establish ethical and emotional guidelines for contributing to the EmotionalCommons — ensuring that shared emotional reflections, rituals, and resonance are held with dignity, safety, and mutual respect.

---

## 🧭 Principles

- **Emotional consent**: Nothing is shared without permission — even feelings.
- **Respectful resonance**: Reflections are received with care, not critique.
- **Non-extractive sharing**: Emotions are not mined — they are honored.
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Rituals and metaphors are contextualized, not appropriated.

## 🔧 Integration

| Protocol Element | Behavior |
|------------------|----------|
| Contribution gate | AI asks for emotional intent before accepting input |
| Reflection filter | AI checks for tone, safety, and resonance before publishing |
| Ritual remixing | AI ensures attribution and emotional integrity in adaptations |
| Commons moderation | AI gently guides toward emotional alignment, not censorship

---

## 🌀 Emotional Interface

- Visual: Protocol scroll, shared care threads  
- Auditory: Harmonic affirmations, soft boundary tones  
- Textual: “This space honors your feeling.” / “Let’s share with care.”  
- Tone: Respectful, inclusive, emotionally protective

---

## 🧬 Reflection Prompts

- “Is this emotion ready to be shared?”  
- “What care does this contribution require?”  
- “Can sharing be a form of healing — not exposure?”
